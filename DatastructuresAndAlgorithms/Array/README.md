# Arrays

A collection of items stored next to each other in memory locations.

Have a fixed memory size

Usually either a one dimensional array or a two dimensional array.

e.g. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and [[0,1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9]]

but really isn't a limit on dimensions.

Arrays are used to implement other data structures such as stack, queue.

Main operations include:
 - Traversal
 - Insertion
 - Deletion
 - Searching
 - Sorting

Advantages:
 - Store multiple data of similar types and same name.
 - Allows for random access to elements.
 - Fixed size, not allowing for overflow.
 - Easy to iterate linearly.

Disadvantages:
 - Size of array is required to be known.
 - Fixed size, therefore can't be modified during runtime.
 - Insertion and deletion operations can be costly.
 - Overallocating memory for array can lead to wasted time.
